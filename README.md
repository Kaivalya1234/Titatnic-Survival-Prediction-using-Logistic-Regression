Logistic regression is basically a supervised classification algorithm. In a classification problem, the target variable(or output), y, can take only discrete values for a given set of features(or inputs), X.

Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. In this case, you'll use logistic regression to determine whether a passenger survived or not based on various features like age, gender, class, etc.
I successfully implemented a logistic regression model for Titanic survival prediction, which yielded an accuracy rate of 74.4%.
